# four-in-a-row-game
gravity four-in-a-row game with Monte Carlo tree
In this project, I have implemented a specialized kind of four-in-a-row little game, and made an AI player for it.
This project is a part of my homework in my course of Computer Program Design, so the game itself and the experiment report are both written in Chinese. English translation is on schedule.
The how-to-play document is included in the game code itself, but its also written in Chinese.
(I didn't know how to use Github at that time; Now I deeply believe that I should at least make a English version of it so everyone can understand what I've done.)
If you know Chinese, compile it and enjoy the game; or you can wait for the English version in future. My apology.
